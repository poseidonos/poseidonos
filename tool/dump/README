./trigger_core_dump collects the dump and debug information from running ibofos or crashed one.
./load_core.sh load the dump by gdb command line. 

1) Before starting test(script/start_ibofos.sh), please run the script 
      # cd script
      # ./setup_env.sh


2) Core file made from your system is so big (128G), please offer us the crash dump. you can get the crash dump with this command with running ibofos.

    *Recommended Option (Running Process)
      - ./trigger_core_dump.sh triggercrash
         => kill the running process and get the crash dump from host. 
         => crash dump size is small and makes process kill, but can get dump fast. 

    *Recommended Option (Crashed Process)
    Or, you also get latest crash core dump with already killed process from segmentation fault.
      - ./trigger_core_dump.sh crashed

    Or, you also get normal core dump with this command from running ibofos. (64G~128G)

      - ./trigger_core_dump.sh gcore
         => gcore dump from ibofos.
         => this will not kill the process

    Or, if you want to get only the ibofos log (dmesg / ibofos log / stdout) please use "logonly"
      * stdout log from ibofos will get if you execute ibofos with "./start_ibofos.sh"
      - ./trigger_core_dump.sh logonly
 

3) Collect_library.py is called with trigger_core_dump.sh. so, please just put this file in the same directory of trigger_core_dump.sh (this script will be automatically called by trigger_core_dump.sh)


4) Output file (tar.gz file including core dump file) from trigger_core_dump.sh can be loaded by load_dump.sh even in other host. 
   First, you need to change or add this script to ~/.gdbinit as below to analyze the c++ stl materials.

     python
     import sys
     sys.path.insert(0, '/usr/share/gcc-9/python/');
     from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
     register_libstdcxx_printers (None)    

   then, you need execute this file 
   [compressed] excludes the "tar.gz.xx"
          # ./load_dump.sh [compressed]


5)Poseidonos leaves in memory log on the its dump. We can retrive this log by two ways.
   (1) From retrive from tar.gz provided by other group.
       ./load_dump.sh [compressed] dumplog
   (2) From core dump or process located in local host.
       ./get_first_info_from_dump.sh
