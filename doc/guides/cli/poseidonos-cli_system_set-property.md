Set the property of PoseidonOS.

### Synopsis

Syntax:
	poseidonos-cli system set-property [--rebuild-impact (high | medium | low)]

Example (To set the impact of rebuilding process on the I/O performance to low):
	poseidonos-cli system set-property --rebuild-impact low

poseidonos-cli system set-property [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                    help for set-property
      --rebuild-impact string   The impact of rebuilding process on the I/O performance.
                                With high rebuilding-impact, the rebuilding process may
                                interfere with I/O operations more. Therefore, I/O operations may
                                slow down although rebuilding process becomes accelerated.
