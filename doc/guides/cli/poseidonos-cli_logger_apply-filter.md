## poseidonos-cli logger apply-filter

Apply a filtering policy to logger.

### Synopsis


Apply a filtering policy to logger.

  - Filtering file: when executing this command, PoseidonOS reads a filtering policy 
  stored in a file. You can set the file path of the filter in the PoseidonOS configuration 
  (the default path is /etc/conf/filter). If the file does not exist, you can create one.
  
  - Filter file format (EBNF):
  [ include: FilterList ]
  [ exclude: FIlterList ]
  FilterList = FilterNumber | FilterNumber,FilterList
  FilterNumber = { ( Number ) | ( Range ) }
  Number = { Digit }
  Range = Number-Number
  
  - Filter file example:
  include: 1002,1005,6230,2000-3000
  exclude: 1006,5003,8000-9000
